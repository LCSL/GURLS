Introduction
============

GURLS - (Grand Unified Regularized Least Squares) is a MATLAB software package for regression and 
(multiclass) classifiers based on the Regularized Least Squares (RLS) loss function. 

Installation
============

Open MATLAB and execute:

>> run('PACKAGEROOT/gurls/utils/gurls_install.m');

where PACKAGEROOT is where you unzipped the GURLS package. This will add all the important directories 
to your path. Run 'savepath' if you want the installation to be permanent.

Documentation
=============

- GURLS design is described here:
	https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS/wiki/3-User-Manual#wiki-Design

- Demos
	GURLS has exstensively commented demos in the "demo" subdirectory. 
	Have a look, and run gurlsdemo.m. We feel this is the best way to learn how to use
	these packages.

- A User manual with several examples can be found here:
	https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS/wiki/3-User-Manual#wiki-GURLS_Usage

- A collection of the most useful and common pipelines can be found here:
	https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS/wiki/3-User-Manual#wiki-Examples_in_GURLS

- The list of all the available methods of the libraries can be found at
	https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS/wiki/4-Available-methods#GURLS_tasks
	
- Developer's Guide
	A simple developer's guides is available in the gurls-manual.pdf file.
	GURLS is designed for easy expansion. Give it a try!


Quick and Dirty
===============
A straightforward example of GURLS uage can be found in gurls_helloworld.m, which employs the Quick and Dirty utilities.
Below we describe more in details how to use them on your data.

Put your training data in a n-by-d matrix X with each row being a data sample.
Put the training labels in a y n-by-one vector. Let the labels go from 1 to T with T 
being the number of classes.

Run:

>> opt = gurls_train(X,y);

Put your test data in a n-by-d matrix Xte like above and your test labels in 
a n-by-one vector yte. Let the labels go from 1 to T with T being the number of classes.

Run: 

>> [yhat, acc] = gurls_test(Xte,yte,opt)

This will train a linear model in the dual space using leave-one-out cross validation.
