Introduction
============

GURLS - (Grand Unified Regularized Least Squares) is a MATLAB software package
for regression and (multiclass) classifiers based on the Regularized Least Squares
(RLS) loss function. GURLS main properties are:

- Automatic parameter selection.
- Great modularity, each method can be used independently.
- Wide range of optimization routines.
- Easy expansion

Installation
============

Open MATLAB and execute:

>> run('PACKAGEROOT/gurls/utils/gurls_install.m');

where PACKAGEROOT is where you unzipped the GURLS package.
This will add all the important directories to your path. Run 'savepath' if
you want the installation to be permanent.

Documentation
=============

- User's Guide:
	A User's Guide with help files for each available method is available
	in the gurls-manual.pdf file.

- Developer's Guide
	A simple developer's guides is available in the gurls-manual.pdf file.
	GURLS is designed for easy expansion. Give it a try!

- Demos
	GURLS has exstensively commented demos in the "demo" subdirectory. 
	Have a look, and run gurlsdemo.m. We feel this is the best way to learn how to use
	these packages.

- Further Documentation
	* A collection of the most useful and common pipelines can be found here:

Quick and Dirty
===============
A straightforward example of GURLS uage can be found in gurls_helloworld.m, which employs the Quick and Dirty utilities.
Below we describe more in details how to use them on your data.

Put your training data in a n-by-d matrix X with each row being a data sample.
Put the training labels in a y n-by-one vector. Let the labels go from 1 to T with T 
being the number of classes.

Run:

>> opt = gurls_train(X,y);

Put your test data in a n-by-d matrix Xte like above and your test labels in 
a n-by-one vector yte. Let the labels go from 1 to T with T being the number of classes.

Run: 

>> [yhat, acc] = gurls_test(Xte,yte,opt)

This will train a linear model in the dual space using leave-one-out cross validation.
