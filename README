Introduction
============

The GRAND UNIFIED LEAST SQUARES software library comprises the following packages.

-GURLS, a MATLAB software library for regression and (multiclass) classification 
based on the Regularized Least Squares (RLS) loss function. 
Datasets that fit into your computer's memory should be handled with this package.

-bGURLS (b is for big), a MATLAB software library that allows to use RLS on very large
matrices by means of memory-mapped storage and a simple distributed task manager.

-GURLS++, a C++ standalone implementation of GURLS, with additional simple API's for specific 
 learning pipelines (currently only the Recursive RLS API is available though we are planning 
 to add soon new API's)

-bGURLS++, a  C++ standalone implementation of bGURLS.

- Further Documentation
	* Have a look at the README files of each individual package.
	
	* In gurls-manual.pdf you can find both the installation instructions and user manual, 
          together with the Matlab and C++ Developer's Guide. GURLS is designed 
	  for easy expansion. Give it a try!
	
	* In recursiveRLS-tutorial.pdf you can find a simple Tutorial for the Recursive 
	  RLS API 

-Test
	Testing routines and scripts are available in the test directories of the gurls 
	and gurls++ package. This checks that gurls and gurls++ results coincide.
