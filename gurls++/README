Introduction
============

GURLS++ is a C++ software library for regression and (multiclass) classification 
based on the Regularized Least Squares (RLS) loss function.

The GURLS webpage can be found at: http://lcsl.mit.edu/gurls.html


Installation
============

You can download the precompiled binaries here
	https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS/tree/master/precompiled-binaries
and start using GURLS++, however such a version may be not optimized for your machine.

If you want a version which is optimized for your machine, follow the steps described in the rest of the section.
 
1) Dependencies
---------------

GURLS++ depends on several external libraries:

- A Blas/Lapack implementation. Currently we support:
  - AMD’s ACML (only for 64 bits);
  - ATLAS;
  - Intel’s MKL;
  - Netlib’s reference implementation: http://www.netlib.org/blas and http://www.netlib.org/lapack/;
  - OpenBLAS (Currently only under Linux);
  - Boost’s (v1.46.0 or higher) libraries serialization, date_time, filesystem, unit_test_framework, system, signals.

2) Automatic dependencies building
----------------------------------

The GURLS++ CMake configurator suppports automatic downloading and building 
of all dependencies by setting the GURLS_USE_EXTERNALS variable to ON (See section 
Configuriation below for details). 
Due to licence restrictions, on Windows this "Superbuild" system does not permit to automatically 
install a blas/lapack implementation so users must install manually blas/lapack libraries.

3) Installing GURLS++ on Linux
-------------------------------

Below we describe how to build and install GURLS++ on Ubuntu (tested on Ubuntu 12.04). 
For other distributions, the same packages must be installed with the distribution-specific method.

1. Install the cmake build system (www.cmake.org/)
 
 $ sudo apt-get install cmake cmake-curses-gui
 
2. To link against some Blas and Lapack implementations you may need a fortran compiler e.g. for gfortran:

 $ sudo apt-get install gfortran

3. Create a build directory (e.g. "build") for GURLS++

 $ cd $GURLS_ROOT
 $ mkdir build
 
4. Run cmake into the build directory

 $ cd build
 $ ccmake ..

The last command will show the CMake interface, which must be used to set the values of some variables 
used for building and installing GURLS++. See the section Configuration below for more information on 
these variables and how to set them to appropriate values.

5. Start building

 $ make

6. Install the library to the path defined at configuration time

 $ make install

The command wil also install to the same path all the dependencies that user chose to build automatically.

4) Installing GURLS++ on Windows
--------------------------------

Below we describe how to build and install GURLS++ on Windows with Visual Studio (tested with 
VS Express 2010 and VS Express 2008).

1. Install the CMake build system downloading the installer from http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html.

2. Install your favourite Blas/Lapack implementation. Under Windows AMD’s ACML is probably the easiest choice, 
since they provide the library binaries for free, however it supports only compilers with 64 bits.

3. Create a build directory (e.g. $GURLSROOT/build).

4. Run the CMake GUI. You will have to set the source directory to $GURLSROOT directory, and the build directory 
   to the directory created at the previous step. After pressing the configure button, you will have 
   to chose the generator for the project (e.g. Visual Studio 10). 
   On Windows you may encounter the error message "error in conﬁguration process, project files may be invalid", 
   check that the you have writing rights to the path specified in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. 
   If this is not the case, change such a variable to a folder to which you have writing rights and 
   press 'configure'. Now you have to set the values of some variables used for building and installing the 
   libraries according to your preferences. See the section Configuration below for more information on these 
   variables and how to set them to appropriate values. 
   After having configured the build options, press the generate button to create the solution file.

5. Open the generated solution under Visual Studio and build it.

6. Optional: install GURLS++ by explicitely building the install project included in the solution 
  (it is not automatically built when building the solution).


5) Configuring GURLS++
----------------------

The configuration step is carried out using CMake. In the following we describe the configuration process 
using the GUI of CMake, e.g. under Windows or Mac. A similar process shall be followed when using the 
command-line interface.

1. Press 'configure', and CMake will try to determine the correct values for all variables. 

2. After the first configuration a list of variables is displayed. The following variables should be checked:
    - CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX The path where the library will be installed to;
    - GURLS_BUILD_GURLSPP (ON): Build GURLS++. If set to ON CMake also evaluates the variables
    - GURLSPP_BUILD_DEMO (ON): Enable the building of the GURLS++ demo programs;
    - GURLSPP_BUILD_DOC (OFF): Enable the building of the GURLS++documentation using doxygen;
    - GURLS_USE_BINARY_ARCHIVES (ON): If set to ON, all data structures are stored in binary (rather than text) 
      files, saving storage space and time;
    - GURLS_USE_EXTERNALS (ON): Enable automatic building of external dependencies.
      If set to ON CMake also evaluates the variables
        - GURLS_USE_EXTERNAL_BLAS_LAPACK (ON): Enable automatic building of blas and lapack, 
          using OpenBLAS (LINUX-ONLY).
        - GURLS_USE_EXTERNAL_BOOST (ON): Enable automatic building of boost. If set to OFF, press 'advanced' 
          to visualize the variables related to the BOOST library, typically you have to specify only the 
          variable BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR;
        For each variable which is set to OFF, you must specify the path to the corresponding library.
      If GURLS_USE_EXTERNALS is set to OFF you have to manually specify the path to all of the above libraries.

3. If CMake does not find some required library, an error message will be displayed. Change the path to required 
   library and press 'configure' again.
   
4. In the main screen you may change a number of variables. Most of them can be left unchanged, but some must be 
   set to appropriate values. The following are the variables whose values should be checked:
    - BLAS_LAPACK_IMPLEMENTATION. Allows user to specify an implementation of the Blas/Lapack routines. 
      Available choices are: ACML, ATLAS, MKL, NETLIB, OPENBLAS (under linux). Depending on the choice you make, 
      CMake will try to find the libraries in standard locations in the system. Normally this process should run 
      fine, however, in case the libraries have been installed in some non-standard directory, you may have 
      to manually specify their location.
      
5. Once all variables have been set, press 'configure' again, and CMake will check the settings. As in step (3), 
   if something is wrong an error message will be displayed and you will have to go back to the main screen to 
   tweak the configuration.

6. When the settings are correct, the option ’generate’ will appear. Press 'generate'. CMake will generate the 
   files and exit.

After the build files (e.g. the Makefile under Linux) have been generated, you can proceed as explained above.
